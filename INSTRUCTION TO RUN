firstly you need to have a JDK kit installed on your computer to run this program !
after installing it , make a directory in the bin..
copy the code and paste it in notepad.
save it with the extension .java
now open cmd and type cd {the path where you have saved or create the file}
type javac nameofthefile.java
then if there are no errors, type java nameofthefile.java
done !
